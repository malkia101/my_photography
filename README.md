# Photography Memories

## Author

## Description
**Queen Photography** is a personal website created to share and celebrate the art of photography. It is designed to showcase a curated collection of my favorite photographs, offer a brief biography of myself as the project creator, and provide a way for visitors to get in touch.

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate the power of photography in capturing fleeting moments, and to invite others to share in the appreciation of visual storytelling. Whether you're a photography enthusiast or someone who simply enjoys beautiful images, this website offers a glimpse into my personal photographic journey.

The website features:
- **A list of favorite photos** that I have captured over time.
- **A biography** of myself, the project creator, accompanied by a personal photo.
- **A contact form** for users to get in touch with me regarding any questions, feedback, or collaborations.
